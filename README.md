# Jackbox Code Guesser

Given the first three letters of a jackbox code, brute forces the 26 remaining possibilities using Selenium

With waits, it takes a while to run...

Potential methods to improve:
* Decrease waiting time somehow
* Use parallel webdrivers to guess code

Not sure if it would be functional without waits tho.

Waits vs No Waits
~16s vs ~2s
